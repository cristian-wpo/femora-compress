Speed up your website. Optimize your JPEG and PNG images automatically with FemoraPro.

== Description ==

Make your website faster by optimizing your JPEG and PNG images to WebP. This plugin automatically optimizes all your images by integrating image compression services FemoraPro.

= Features =

* Easy bulk optimization of your existing media library.
* Automatically resize huge image uploads by setting a maximum width and/or height for more reasonable browser display.
* Turn your images into WebP format.
* WooCommerce compatible (see below).
* See your usage on the settings page and during bulk optimization.

= How does it work? =

After you upload an image to your WordPress site, each resized image is uploaded to the FemoraPro service. Your image is analyzed to apply the best possible optimization. Based on the content of your image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is sent back to your WordPress site and will replace the original image with one smaller in size. On average JPEG images are compressed by 40-80% and PNG images by 50-80% without visible loss in quality. Your website will load faster for your visitors, and you’ll save storage space and bandwidth!

= Getting started =

Install this plugin and follow the instructions to set up your account. With a regular WordPress installation you can optimize 5.000 images a month for free. Each thumbnail is treated as an individual image. Once installed you can also switch to a [paid account](https://www.femora.pro/) which removes the limits and allows you to optimize as many images as you like.

= Optimizing all your images =

You can optimize all your existing JPEG and PNG images at once by going to Femora Compress > Search Images and clicking Optimize. It will start the optimization of the images in your media library.

The plugin is fully multi-site compatible.
